## Tech stack used 💻

- Front end : It is made using React, HTML and CSS and you can customize the look of the Boss Machine by accessing the code in the `src` folder. 

- Back end : It is made using `Express.js` and is present in the [server](https://github.com/sharmaaditya570191/BossY/tree/master/server) folder.  

- Data base : It is organised using JavaScript and is present in [db.js](https://github.com/sharmaaditya570191/BossY/blob/master/server/db.js) under `server` directory. The database uses `faker.js` to generate massive amounts of realistic fake data in `Node.js` and the `browser`.

- Tests ⚠️ : The tests are written using Mocha and Chai as the assertion library and are present in the [test](https://github.com/sharmaaditya570191/BossY/tree/master/test) folder.
